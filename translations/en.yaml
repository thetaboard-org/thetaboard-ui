  what_staking_body: "<p>Staking is a process that involves associating your tokens to a machine that is completing work
                 and providing security to a network, which results in you earning additional rewards.<br/>
                Your rewards for staking are based on the number of tokens you stake, as well as the uptime of your node.
                   To maximise your staking earnings, the computer hosting your node needs to be left running 24/7.<br/>
                On the Theta Network, staking of both Theta token and Tfuel token is possible. Both tokens are rewarded for staking in the form of Tfuel.
                   To stake your tokens, they need to be delegated to either a Guardian Node (Theta) or an Elite Edge Node (Tfuel).
                    Both types of nodes play important roles within the Theta decentralised network.<br/>
                Throughout the process of staking, the tokens always stay inside your official Theta wallet. If the node were to ever switch off,
                   the tokens remain in your wallet, and will only be controlled by whoever has access to the wallet.
                    NEVER enter your 12-word seed phrase, or keystore file and password, anywhere except the official Theta Wallet.
                     Thetaboard will never request this information.</p>

  stake: "Can I stake my Tfuel or Theta tokens from an exchange?"
  stake_body: "<p>No, staking on the Theta Network is currently only possible using the tokens you have deposited into your official Theta wallet.<br/>
                  We suggest using the Wallet link available at the top of the <a href=\"https://www.thetatoken.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thetatoken.org/</a> and bookmarking
                  this as the way to access your official wallet and avoid scams. This is the only location you should ever enter your 12 word seed phrase, or keystore file and password.</p><br/>

  where_nodes: "Where are the nodes Thetaboard uses?"
  where_nodes_body: "<p>Thetaboard has nodes spread across the USA and Canada. We plan to extend to other parts of the world as well.</p><br/>
                <br/><br/>"
  fees: "What fees does Thetaboard have?"
  fees_body: "<p>Thetaboard fees for hosting Theta is 3% and Tfuel node is 5% of the rewards earned</p><br/>
                <br/><br/>"
  minimum: "What are the current minimum number of tokens for staking?"
  minimum_body: "<p>For staking on the Theta Network, the minimum amounts are:</p><br/>
                <p>1000 Theta tokens, or<br/>
                10,000 Tfuel tokens.</p><br/>
                <p>Theses limits are set by Theta Labs and have changed in the past. While possible, there is no stated timeline by Theta Labs for future changes of these minimums.</p><br/>
                <br/><br/>"
  when_earn: "When do I earn my rewards?"
  when_earn_body: "<p>The Theta Network uses a weighted randomly assigned method to send out staking rewards. The algorithms are different for each token.</p><br/>
                <h4>Theta</h4>
                <p>Theta staking rewards are paid out every 100 blocks to different stakes, with size of stake increasing the chance of regular payouts.
                   The amount of Theta staked to the Guardian Node makes no difference.<br/>
                Theta staking reward amounts are assigned by the Theta blockchain in multiples of 12. Thetaboard fees will
                 be taken out by the time the transaction arrives in your wallet, meaning the amounts will be in multiples of 11.64.</p><br/>
                <h4>Tfuel</h4>
                <p>Tfuel staking rewards are paid out every 100 blocks to Edge Nodes, with amount of
                  Tfuel staked to that Edge Node increasing the chance of regular payouts. The size of the individual Tfuel stake makes no difference.<br/>
                Tfuel staking reward amounts vary greatly, based on the size of your stake. They are often three decimal places and are regularly 5 Tfuel and under.</p><br/>
                <br/><br/>"
  how_much_earn: "How much Tfuel do I earn?"
  how_much_earn_body: "<p>Use the reward forecast calculator available on the Thetaboard Dashboard page to calculate the earnings you are predicted to see for the size of your stake.</p><br/>
                <br/><br/>"
  public_private: "Should I use a Public or Private Elite Edge Node?"
  public_private_body: "<p>Many Thetaboard customers use both. Sharing a node will increase the frequency (but not the amount) of your payments,
                as the node will hold more Tfuel than if you were staking alone, so the chances of being picked in the rewards algorithm is increased.
                Your place is not reserved when you unstake, but we will continue to provide more Public Elite Edge Nodes as required.
                Also, separating out a 10,000 Tfuel stake and placing it on a Public Elite Edge Node allows for a smaller amount of your
                Tfuel to be withdrawn and added to, so unstaking does not affect your entire staked amount.</p><br/>
                <br/><br/>"
  where_rewards_from: "Where do these rewards come from?"
  where_rewards_from_body: "<p>Theta Network uses inflation of Tfuel tokens to pay staking rewards. This inflation of Tfuel is set at 38 Tfuel per block for Tfuel staking,
                and 48 Tfuel per block for Theta staking. The Theta Network aims for 6 second blocks, at which point the inflation rates correspond to
                roughly 4% (Tfuel staking rewards) and 5% (Theta staking rewards) inflation of the initial Tfuel supply of 5 billion.</p><br/>
                <p>This inflation is planned to be offset by burning of a portion of fees paid to use the Theta Network. Theta Labs has stated they
                aim to keep the total supply of Tfuel close to the initial 5 billion supply.</p><br/>
                <br/><br/>"
  staking_wallet: "What do staking rewards look like in my wallet?"
  staking_wallet_body: "<p>Staking rewards on our dashboard, in the form of a 'coinbase' transaction, will be sent to the wallet you staked your tokens from.
                The 'from' address in these coinbase transactions will be one of the 16 Validator Node addresses in the Theta Network.</p><br/>
                <p>If you are using the Theta Wallet to track your rewards, they will not appear as transactions, but only as an increase in the available Tfuel balance.</p><br/>
                <br/><br/>"
  no_rewards: "How come I have not received Theta staking rewards for a week?"
  no_rewards_body: "<p>If you are staking an amount of Theta closer to the minimum, it is possible you may go weeks without payment due to the Theta Labs staking rewards algorithm.
                Be assured, you are still accruing rewards, and just need the staking algorithm to select you for reward payment.</p><br/>
                <p>Even if you go through long periods without staking rewards, your rewards are still accruing.
                Often you will receive more than normal a short period following a long dry spell without rewards.</p><br/>
                <p>Discussion of the randomized block reward for Theta by Theta Labs is found here:</p><br/>
                <p><a traget=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/theta-network/theta-protocol-code-v2-2-0-released-with-important-performance-related-updates-6b9e2261d0ae\">https://medium.com/theta-network/theta-protocol-code-v2-2-0-released-with-important-performance-related-updates-6b9e2261d0ae</a></p><br/>
                <p>Prior to Mainnet 3.0 in June 2021, all theta staking rewards were delivered in transactions with a multiple of 12. However, since then, instances where Theta staking rewards have been joined to Tfuel staking rewards have occurred.
                This makes it harder to track which payment is coming for what stake. While our dashboard makes every attempt to correctly assign Theta and Tfuel staking rewards correctly,
                it may not capture every joint payment, as these are not labelled on the Theta blockchain.</p>

  withdraw_add_more: "Do I have to withdraw my stake to add new tokens?"
  withdraw_add_more_body: "<p>If the amount you wish to add is under the minimum requirements for staking (1000 Theta and 10,000 Tfuel), then yes you will have to unstake your original amount to add new tokens.
                If the amount is over the minimum requirements, just stake the new amount as a new stake.</p><br/>

  domain: "What are the Theta Domain Names available to be purchased through Thetaboard?"
  domain_body: "<p>Domains are currently a proof of concept. You can currently buy and sell Domains, and use them to Search Wallets by name within Thetaboard's website, and toshow your support to Thetaboard.<br/>
                At some point in 2021 we will migrate to final contracts. These will be NFT's and will be integrated in the theta wallets, in order to do transactions using domain names instead of wallet addresses.<br/>
                However, we won't be able to migrate currently bought domains to the new version.<br/>
